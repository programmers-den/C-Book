\chapter*{Foreword}
This book, along with the larger Programmer's Den Open Book Initiative,
began as a collaboration between several developers on the Programmer's Den
discord server. The goal of the initiative is to create a series of books for
programming languages, leaning on our experience as a software development
learning community to highlight common pitfalls and steer new developers
clear of traps they would not otherwise be able to foresee.
